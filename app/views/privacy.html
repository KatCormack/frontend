The term "Personal Data" refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, job description, health related data, birthdate, e-mail address or mailing address.

      <h4>Notification of changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>We are continually improving our methods of communication and adding new functionality and features to the Buddy App and to our existing services.

If and when our data practices change, we will notify you through this privacy policy, and the local data authority, (where required by law), of the changes. We encourage you to check our website frequently for updates.</p>
      <h4>Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses and mobile phone numbers</h4>
      <p>When you choose to register on Buddy App we request personal information about you such as your name, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also ask for demographic information such as age and gender. The information you provide is electronically stored in our databases.</p>
      <h4>Use of Personal Data</h4>
      <p>Your Personal Data is only used for the following purposes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          to help provide an effective standard of personal care,
        </li>
        <li>
          to help your healthcare provider (e.g. NHS) assess, monitor, and improve the services provided,
        </li>
        <li>
          to allow us to administer this program efficiently,
        </li>
        <li>
          to analyse and evaluate the benefits of the Buddy system.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Updating your personal details</h4>
      <p>If you change your mobile phone number of your email address, you can update your details on the Buddy website by logging onto your account and going to "Settings".</p>
      <h4>Use of Personal Data</h4>
      <p>The information that you enter into Buddy App is completely confidential and will not be made available to anyone, except in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your Health Professionals (e.g. therapist or psychological wellbeing practitioner) will be able to access and review your entries to allow them to monitor your progress through the system and to help you to plan your sessions in collaboration. It will be clear when entering information, which information they will be able to see.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may require access to this data to help support you to use the program.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Anonymous data collected through Buddy App</h4>
      <p>Summaries of anonymous data (for example average daily wellbeing scores of all users) will be used to improve the service, and may be used in publications or presentations at conferences or on the website to indicate the effectiveness of the service.</p>
      <p>This anonymous data will consist solely of summary information and will not include any personal information that can be used to identify the users of the service. Your use of the service implies consent for the use of summary data in this way.</p>
      <p>In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, our web server automatically logs which pages of our website our visitors view, their IP addresses and which web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website.</p>
      <p>Our website may be developed to contain hyperlinks to other pages on our website. We may use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on our website our visitors choose to view. Again this technology does not identify you personally – it simply enables us to compile statistics about the use of these hyperlinks.</p>
      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed.</p>
      <p>Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not.</p>
      <p>We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.</p>
      <h4>Disclosure of your Personal Data</h4>
      <p>We do not share, sell or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy and under these limited circumstances:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We may share, transfer or disclose the information in our databases and server logs to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, interacting with anti-fraud databases, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this website, or to take precautions against legal liability. We will inform you of any such transfer or disclosure as required by law.</li>
        <li>Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Data access and corrections</h4>
      <p>Data entered onto this site may form a part of your medical records. If you wish the Personal Data we hold to be disclosed to you then you should make this request through your healthcare provider.</p>
      <p>Requests to delete Personal Data can only be made through your health care provider and are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on us.</p>
      <p>If you require a copy of these records, you should request a hard-copy from your health professional before you are discharged from the service.</p>
      <p>You may update certain items of information you have entered by logging onto your account and using the 'edit my details' facility. For all other changes you should contact your local Buddy App provider.</p>
      <h4>Links to other websites</h4>
      <p>In future, the website may contain hyperlinks to websites that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third-party websites or any association with their operators. We do not control these websites and are not responsible for their data or privacy practices. We urge you to review any privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any Personal Data about yourself.</p>
      <h4>Your obligations</h4>
      <p>It is your responsibility to keep your password safe and to ensure that when using the program it cannot be accessed by other people without your consent.</p>
      <p>It is also your responsibility to ensure SMS messages are kept secure - we recommend the use of password locks on your mobile phone.</p>
      <p>The company cannot accept any liability for loss or disclosure of your personal data resulting from your failure to keep your password safer allowing unauthorised persons access to the programme whilst it is in use by you or loss or theft of your mobile phone.</p>
      <h4>Transfer of data abroad</h4>
      <p>If you are visiting Buddy App from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (currently UK), the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.</p>
      <p>By visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h4>Governing Law</h4>
      <p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our website Terms and Conditions and the substantive laws of England, as described in the Terms and Conditions, will apply to this Privacy Policy.</p>

While we operate our own virus protection procedures, you assume total responsibility for establishing such procedures for virus checking as you consider necessary. This is a comprehensive limitation of liability that applies to all losses and damages whatsoever, whether the alleged liability is based on contract, negligence, tort, strict liability or any other basis. If any part of this limitation of liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then the aggregate liability of Buddy Enterprises, its affiliates, service providers and licensors under such circumstances for liabilities that otherwise would have been limited, shall not exceed £100.</p>
